CropPhenology package extracts phenological metrics from time series of seasonal vegetation index data. It has two functions: PhenoMetrics and MultiPointsPLots. PhenoMetrics create a raster stack or a table of phenological metrics for polygon or point area of interstes, respectively.

Prerequesites - packages 'raster', 'rgdal', 'maptools', 'shapefiles' and 'xlsx' are required.

Installation  - The CropPhenology package can be installed from GitHub repository using 'Devtools' package. Hence, Devtools should be installed and loaded prior to the CropPhenology installation. The following code lines provide the installation steps:
